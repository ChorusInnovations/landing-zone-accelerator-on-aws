## What is the [security risk](https://panost.pages.aws.dev/proserve-security-guidance/terms/#risk) introduced by this change?
<!-- If you believe that an adversary will not be interested in attempting to exploit the new functionality, then post your reasons under the first question and skip the other two. If you are not sure how to respond to any of these questions, please reach out to Panos Thomas (https://phonetool.amazon.com/users/panost). -->
1. What value might the new functionality have for an adversary?
   <!-- This question is about the "why" of an attack, not about whether it succeeds or not. Your response should therefore not take into account the security controls that are in place to prevent attacks. -->
2. If your life depended on it, how would you attempt to exploit it?
3. What [security controls](https://panost.pages.aws.dev/proserve-security-guidance/controls) are in place to defend against such attempts?
